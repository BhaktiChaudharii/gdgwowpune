# My Journey as a GDG WOW Pune Volunteer

## Introduction

Hello everyone! I'm Bhakti Chaudhari, and I want to share my incredible journey as a volunteer with Google Developer Group Women of Wonder (GDG WOW) Pune. Being part of this vibrant community has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional life, and I hope my story inspires others to get involved.

## How It All Started

My journey began in early 2024 when I attended my first GDG WOW event in Pune - a workshop on "Women in AI." As someone who was passionate about both artificial intelligence and increasing women's representation in tech, I was immediately drawn to the community's mission and energy. The event was not just informative but also incredibly welcoming, with women from diverse backgrounds coming together to learn and support each other.

After the event, I approached the organizers to learn more about how I could contribute. Within a week, I found myself as part of the volunteer team for the upcoming "WOW Tech Summit 2024."

## My Volunteer Experience

### Event Planning and Organization

As a volunteer, I had the opportunity to work on various aspects of event planning:

- **Venue Coordination**: Helped scout potential venues and managed logistics for our monthly meetups
- **Speaker Outreach**: Reached out to potential speakers and coordinated their sessions
- **Registration Management**: Handled attendee registrations and queries
- **Technical Setup**: Assisted with setting up equipment for workshops and presentations

### Workshop Facilitation

One of my favorite roles was facilitating technical workshops. I helped organize:

- Flutter App Development Workshop (April 2024)
- Machine Learning Study Jam (June 2024)
- Web Development Bootcamp (September 2024)

Seeing participants go from having little knowledge to building their first app or model was incredibly fulfilling. The joy on their faces when they completed a project successfully made all the hard work worthwhile.

### Community Building

Beyond events, I actively participated in community building initiatives:

- Moderated our online community forum
- Created weekly tech learning resources
- Mentored newcomers to help them navigate the tech ecosystem
- Contributed to our inclusive code of conduct and community guidelines

## Impact and Growth

### Personal Growth

Volunteering with GDG WOW Pune has significantly impacted my personal and professional development:

- My **public speaking skills** improved dramatically through introducing speakers and occasionally running sessions
- I built a strong **professional network** of like-minded women in technology
- My **technical knowledge** expanded as I helped prepare workshop materials
- I developed strong **leadership and organizational skills** managing event teams

### Community Impact

What makes me most proud is the impact our work has had on the community:

- We've seen a **50% increase in women attending** tech events in Pune
- Several participants have transitioned from non-tech to tech roles after our career workshops
- Many women have reported gaining confidence to speak at tech conferences after attending our speaker mentorship program
- We've built partnerships with local colleges to introduce more female students to tech careers early

## Challenges and Learnings

The journey wasn't without challenges:

- **Time Management**: Balancing volunteering with professional responsibilities was sometimes difficult
- **Limited Resources**: Working with budget constraints required creative solutions
- **Diversity Beyond Gender**: Ensuring our community was inclusive not just for women but for people of all backgrounds

These challenges taught me valuable lessons about prioritization, resourcefulness, and the importance of true inclusion.

## Looking Forward

As I continue my volunteer journey with GDG WOW Pune, I'm excited about:

- Launching our mentorship program pairing experienced women in tech with newcomers
- Expanding our outreach to smaller cities and towns around Pune
- Creating more advanced technical workshops based on community feedback
- Building stronger partnerships with companies to improve employment opportunities
